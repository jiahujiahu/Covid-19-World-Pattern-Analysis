# COVID-19 World Pattern Analysis

This project focuses on visualizing the COVID-19 pandemic data using R and different packages, specifically ggplot2 and tmap.

## Overview

In this analysis, we leverage the ggplot2 package to create visualizations of the COVID-19 situation in major regions and cities. By representing the data using points, we enable a detailed examination of smaller countries and specific cities, providing valuable insights into their individual scenarios.

Additionally, we adopt a different approach by utilizing the tmap package and representing the data in the form of polygons. This method offers a broader view of the overall COVID-19 situation, allowing us to understand the patterns and trends across different countries and regions on a larger scale.

We combine these two visualization techniques to gain a comprehensive understanding of the global COVID-19 landscape, examining both the finer details and the broader picture.

Feel free to explore the code and visualizations in this repository to gain insights into the COVID-19 world pattern.

Note: The project may require access to up-to-date COVID-19 data. Ensure you have the necessary datasets or consider adapting the code to use the latest data sources.
